## **Project Description:**
#### This project provides a graphical user interface to play Blackjack. In order to win, a player must try to get a hand greater than the dealer's hand. However, the player's hand must not exceed 21 or they will bust resulting in a loss. The dealer can bust as well so it is up to luck and the player's choices to try to get the greater hand. A player receives a "blackjack" if they are dealt a hand worth 21 on the first turn. If the player receives a blackjack and the dealer does not, a multiplyer is added to the player's bet for that game. The project also provides the player with the rules for Blackjack as well as access to a shop where they can change the looks of their cards.
